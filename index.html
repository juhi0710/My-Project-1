Buying in quantity has been popular since the advent of big-box retailers like Costco and Walmart, but the coronavirus lockdown seems to have accelerated the practice.

The opportunity for new delivery is to extend food delivery to a new group of restaurants and customers. Rather than competing directly with the aggregators, new-delivery players are expanding the overall market.
